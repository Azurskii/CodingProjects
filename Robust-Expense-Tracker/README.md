Robust Expense & Budget Tracker:
A dynamic Python application designed to track personal finances by mapping expenses to specific categories and comparing totals against a monthly income.

Core Features:

User-Defined Categories: Uses a dictionary to link expense labels (keys) to their costs (values).

Input Validation: Employs try/except blocks to catch non-numeric inputs, ensuring the program doesn't crash during data entry.

Dynamic Budgeting: Calculates remaining balance or overages in real-time based on total accumulated spending.

Iterative Data Entry: Uses a while True loop with a customized exit condition for a seamless user experience.

Technical Tools Used

Data Structures: Dictionaries ({}) and Lists ([]).

Exception Handling: ValueError catching for robust string-to-float conversion.

Built-in Functions: sum(), float(), input(), and .items().

Control Flow: if/elif/else logic and while loops.

Formatted Strings: f-strings for clean, readable output.
